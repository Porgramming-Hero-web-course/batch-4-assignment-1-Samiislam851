# The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

TypeScript’s static typing and advanced type features help make code safer, more readable, and less buggy. Two essential types—**union** and **intersection types**—are incredibly useful for creating flexible applications.

## What Are Union and Intersection Types?

- **Union Types** let a value be one of multiple types, adding flexibility. Defined using a pipe '`|`', they’re ideal when a variable could represent several types.
  
  ```typescript
  type Status = "success" | "error" | "loading";

  function displayStatus(status: Status) {
      if (status === "success") console.log("Operation successful!");
      else if (status === "error") console.log("An error occurred.");
      else console.log("Loading...");
  }
  ```
Intersection Types combine multiple types into one, ensuring an object meets all type requirements. Created with an ampersand (&), intersections help create precise data structures.

```typescript
type Address = { street: string; city: string; };
type Contact = { name: string; phone: string; };

type Person = Address & Contact;

const person: Person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    phone: "123-456-7890",
    street: "123 Elm St",
    city: "Somewhere"
};
```

## When to Use Union vs. Intersection Types
- **Union Types:** Use when a value could be one of several types (an "OR" condition).
- **Intersection Types:** Use when an object must satisfy multiple type requirements simultaneously (an "AND" condition).
Key Benefits
1. **Type Safety:** TypeScript enforces type rules, reducing errors.
1. **Clarity:** Union and intersection types make code more understandable.
1. **Flexibility:** They allow for a wide range of data inputs and combinations without verbose code.
